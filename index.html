          <dt><a href="colorapp/index.html">Color App</a></dt>
          <dd>Some backstory for this app; my phone contact photos are all random, solid colors and at first I did that by finding images of colors that contained multiple shades so I could simply zoom in on different sections of the picture to get the effect I wanted. I discovered though that with updates to my OS, the images would revert back to displaying the full size and it ruined the aesthetic I was going for. I looked for websites online to help me randomly generate colors that could be saved as images but I had no luck. That being the case, I decided to build it myself. I created my HSV slider as a means to understand the HSV model better since I found it allowed me more versatility than the RGB model did for my Random Colors app. Now I have an app that allows the user to select how many colors to generate as well as convert them into individual canvases that can be saved as images. I have begun adding functionality to filter the colors generated into red's, blue's, and green's, though further refinement is necessary.</dd>

          <dt>Travel Log(work in progress)</dt>
          <dd>Shortly after buying a new car, I had an idea; I wanted a web app I could use to log my miles driven, the day those miles were driven, and whether they were personal or work related miles. It's a fairly basic app, but one that I decided to build myself for fun rather than use something else online or simply keep a physical notebook.</dd>
