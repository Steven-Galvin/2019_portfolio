          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>My name is Steven Galvin and I am a web developer based in the Portland, OR area. Creativity and innovation are both at the forefront of everything I do, and both of those traits lead me to the wonderful world of web development. I love taking a blank document and turning it into something you can see or interact with. My passion for learning new technologies, exploring new ideas, and troubleshooting my way through life's obstacles flourishes through coding, and I hope to bring that energy with me into the professional setting.</p>

          <dt><a href="color_app/random_color_generator">Color App</a></dt>
          <dd>Some backstory for this app; my phone contact photos are all random, solid colors and at first I did that by finding images of colors that contained multiple shades so I could simply zoom in on different sections of the picture to get the effect I wanted. I discovered though that with updates to my OS, the images would revert back to displaying the full size and it ruined the aesthetic I was going for. I looked for websites online to help me randomly generate colors that could be saved as images but I had no luck. That being the case, I decided to build it myself. I created my HSV Playground as a means to understand the HSV model better since I found it allowed me more versatility than the RGB model did for my Random Colors app. Now I have an app that allows the user to select how many colors to generate as well as convert them into individual canvases that can be saved as images. I have begun adding functionality to filter the colors generated into red's, blue's, and green's, though further refinement is necessary.</dd>

          <dt><a href="portland_historical_tours/index">Portland Historical Tours</a></dt>
          <dd>This was my final project for my Principles of HTML and CSS course at Portland Community College. This website is contains static pages displaying information for the fictional company, Portland Historical Tours. In this project, I started with taking a content inventory to breakdown the demographic the company wants to target, the pages on the website, and the content of those pages. Followed by wireframes for both desktop and mobile versions of the website. Then finally I coded the website out while keeping web best practices (according to <em>Web Development and Design Foundations with HTML5 9th Edition</em> by Terry Ann Felke-Morris, Ed.D.) in mind. The website was also designed and developed responsively.</dd>

          <dt><a href="on_the_soul/index.php">On The Soul Blog</a> - (WIP)</dt>
          <dd>This is a PHP and MySQL powered blog I'm building for a good friend of mine. He approached me for help shortly after I had finished a Wordpress course at Portland Community College, and I decided I wanted to push myself to create this blog entirely from scratch with no help from a CMS. Curious to understand PHP better after my limited experience with it from my Wordpress course, I jumped at the chance and this blog is the result of my studies and practice.</dd>
          <!-- <dt>Travel Log - (WIP)</dt>
          <dd>Shortly after buying a new car, I had an idea; I wanted a web app I could use to log my miles driven, the day those miles were driven, and whether they were personal or work related miles. It's a fairly basic app, but one that I decided to build myself for fun rather than use something else online or simply keep a physical notebook.</dd> -->
